# Overview

The **Submit Your Content** solution pack empowers community members to seamlessly submit their solutions for review on FortiSOARâ€™s Content Hub. By launching their FortiSOAR instance and leveraging playbooks, users can streamline the submission process, ensuring efficient handling of their valuable contributions.

This solution pack simplifies content submission by breaking down the entire process into manageable steps addressed through user-friendly interfaces.

- **Integrated with FortiSOAR**: Content submission is seamlessly integrated with FortiSOAR. You can use the FortiSOAR Content Hub's **Create** option to create solution packs, widgets, or connectors directly from the FortiSOAR interface. Once you've created your content, use the **Submit Your Content** solution pack to submit it to the FortiSOAR Integrations team for review and subsequent upload to the Content Hub.

- **Ensuring Complete Details**: The user interface (UI) includes a form that captures mandatory details about the solution pack, widget, or connector created for the Content Hub. By collecting all necessary information upfront, this process eliminates the need for back-and-forth communication between the integration team and content creators due to missing information.
